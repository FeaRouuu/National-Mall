							<h2>The Washington Monument</h2>
							<p>The Washington Monument is an obelisk-shaped tower over 169 meters high. It was in February 1885 in honor of George Washington that it was inaugurated.
							The construction work lasted almost forty years, from 1848 to 1885. At its completion, until the erection of the Eiffel Tower in 1889, it was the tallest monument in the world with 169 m.
							In September 1833, the Washington National Monument Society was created, by John Marshall and James Madison, to raise funds to build a monument in memory of George Washington. In 1836, she launched a competition to decide the nature of the monument, won by Robert Mills. In 1847, she believed that she had collected enough money to begin construction of the monument.
							The Washington Monument had to be built at the crossroads between a line going south from the White House and a line going west of the Capitol (on the site of what is now Jefferson Pier). However, the soil there could not have supported the structure. It was therefore erected at the western end of the National Mall.</p>

									<p>"I remember as a child the subject of slavery was taboo we shouldn't talk about it, nobody dared. My parents said they were black and black with pickaxe they worked in the fields, in their own childhood they saw their family friends die diseases, insalubrity, they were treated like cattle, simple objects that have walks and whose greenhouse is to make the household, agriculture all the ungrateful and degrading stains. they were persecuted left for dead in the sun, mistreated, hopeless and helpless. No one to help them just used to work, food for subsistence. of course they came to them the idea of ​​trying to free themselves but what to do when you have strength that you don't sleep for fear of dying of anything. See it is a very different vision of life when you are there to see a piece of bread for 5 people children born in this hell that changes you, don't not talk about it will be a buzz, this subject was it is a taboo to me but today speaking is a liberation."</p>
